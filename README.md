The Potato Disease Classification project is a application that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify potato leaf images into categories such as 'Early Blight,' 'Late Blight,' or 'Healthy.' The project leverages TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the CNN, and Gradio for creating an intuitive user interface for real-time image classification.

## Features

- **Image Classification:** Classifies potato leaf images into disease categories using a trained CNN model.
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Users can upload images and receive classification results with confidence scores via a Gradio interface.
- **Visual Metrics:** Training metrics such as accuracy and loss are visualized using Matplotlib.
